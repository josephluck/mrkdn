##### London | josephreubenluck@gmail.com | [Resume](../resume)

I'm a software engineer with a profound interest in design, user experience and functional programming in languages such as JavaScript and TypeScript. I'm also a passionate contributor to open source having published libraries through [GitHub](https://github.com/josephluck) and [Npm](https://www.npmjs.com/~josephluck).

## Skills

I have commercial experience in a wide range of front-end tools and libraries. Whilst there are many to list, I am particularly experienced with functional programming in TypeScript using libraries such as React, Redux, Ramda and Jest. I also have experience with CoffeeScript, ES6/7 and NodeJS as well as other popular MVC libraries such as Vue, Angular and Backbone. Aside from my technical skills, I pride myself on being an excellent problem solver with a focus on design and user experience.
